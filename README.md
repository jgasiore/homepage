## About
https://jgasiore.github.io/homepage/

On the site you will learn more about me. I have divided it into five parts:
- About me
- More about me
- Expierience
- Offer
- Contact

In addition to text, the content of the section uses images, tables and links as well as a contact form. The site also has a button with which we can change the background of the page.

## Technologies

The project is created with:
- HTML
- CSS
- BEM
- JavaScript Features

## Status

The site is growing rapidly, along with the new front-end programming skills I am learning.

## Inspiration

My attendance at the Frontend Developer course.

*If you have any questions or need help with the frontend, I encourage you to contact [Youcode](https://youcode.pl/zostawiam-maila/).*
